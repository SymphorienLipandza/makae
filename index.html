		<p> In this lesson, we’ll cover common Git commands used to manage your projects and to upload your work onto GitHub.
 We refer to these commands as the basic Git workflow. When you’re using Git, these are the commands that you’ll use 70-80% of the 
time, so if you can get these down, you’ll be more than halfway done mastering Git!</p>
